#Binary Tree implementation

if a node is at index - i
it's left child is at - 2*i
it's right child is at - 2*i+1
it's parent is at - floor(i/2)

A full binary tree is: if hight is h then it has maximum 
number of nodes. = 2^(h+1) - 1 nodes.
So, binary tree with maximum number of nodes is a full binary tree.


Complete binary tree: If there is no gap in between the elements of 
array representation of a binary tree is called a complete binary
tree.

So every full binary tree is complete binary tree.
The height of a compelte binary tree is always is log(n).

Heap is a complete binary tree.
