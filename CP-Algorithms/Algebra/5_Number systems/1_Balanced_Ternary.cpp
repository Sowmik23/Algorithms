/*##Conversion of Decimal to Balanced Ternary system :

1. Convert decimal to ternary number system.
2. Convert ternary to balanced ternary system, using below steps: 
traverse the ternary number, right to left by leaving 0 and 1 as it is
when encounter 2, change it to Z and add +1 to the next digit in iteration.
Some digits may become +3, then replace +3 with 0 and add +1 to next digit in iteration.
complete this process until you convert all the digits.
